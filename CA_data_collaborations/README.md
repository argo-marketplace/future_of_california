# Web Scrapping
- DataCollaboratives.ipynb contains the code used for web scrapping

- The notebooks is written in Python3 and uses packages BeautifulSoup and PyGithub 

- The notebook by default assumes that the user has a Github access token, and the token is saved in a separate file named config.py

- Due to the Github API's access rate limit, the notebook takes a few hours to complete, do not shut down or hibernate your computer during that process

- The results, complying with the requirements in README_data_collabs.md, are ouputed to csv files gov_repo_count.csv and gov_repo_spec.csv
