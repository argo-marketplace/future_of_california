# Brigade Resources 

![California Dreaming Map](../images/california-dreaming-pano.jpg)

This repo exists to help pioneer a brighter future in California and beyond. The [principles articulated here](https://argo-marketplace.github.io/future_of_california/) aim to accelerate good government through great public technology.

## Template Workshop 

Goal is to build out a template workshop that can be used to support local brigades in their practices:

1. How can <my brigade> implement the principles that most resonate with our community?
2. List of discussion questions on the risks of better public technology.
3. Connection with the directory of resources being developed by Cori Zarek at CfA.

More to come! (Also note a great opportunity to use https://discourse.codeforamerica.org/)

## Building alliances

Idea is to redeploy the Asheville model of meeting at other civic organizations and collaborating with them to use civic technology to explore how civic technology can support their work. 

*Call to action*

- One low hanging fruit is to ask organizations to include their logo on bit.ly/californias_future
- Other ideas?

## Develop Videos

- Short 2-3 minute videos that explain great civic practices
